                        Water Technology BD Ltd (WTB) & HKF Engineering & Trading are the nationâ€™s leading wastewater treatment plant engineers with industrial wastewater treatment expertise successfully working with Effluent Treatment Plant or ETP is one type of waste water treatment method which is particularly designed to purify industrial waste water for its reuse and its aim is to release safe water to environment from the harmful effect caused by the effluent.

                        Industrial effluents contain various materials, depending on the industry. Some effluents contain oils and grease, and some contain toxic materials (e.g., cyanide). Effluents from food and beverage factories contain degradable organic pollutants. Since industrial waste water contains a diversity of impurities and therefore specific treatment technology called ETP is required.
